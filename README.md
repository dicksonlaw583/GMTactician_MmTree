# GMTactician Collection: Minimax Tree Devkit

## Introduction

This library provides a basic framework for implementing the [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm enhanced with [Alpha-Beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-beta_pruning). Both synchronous and asynchronous evaluation are supported. For games with a clear running score, you can develop a basic AI off just the basic rules of the game and a quick score heuristic.

## Requirements

GameMaker Studio 2022 / 2.3.7 or higher

If you use GameMaker Studio 2.3.0 - 2.3.6, please use [v1.0.0](https://github.com/dicksonlaw583/GMTactician_MmTree/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

## Installation

Get the asset package and the associated documentation from [the releases page](https://github.com/dicksonlaw583/GMTactician_MmTree/releases). Simply extract everything to your project, including the extension and the companion scripts. Once you do that, you may optionally change the configurations in `__MM_CONFIGS__` to suit your projects needs.
